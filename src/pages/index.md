    title: About VanHacks
    description: 
        - p:
            VanHacks is an annual hackathon organized by TTT Studios around
            VSW dedicated to helping those helping our community. We call
            you, hackers of Vancouver, to join us over a weekend to
            create tech solutions that solve challenging issues faced by
            our community's not-for-profit institutions whose aim is to do
            social good. With your help, we can work towards building a
            better, more unified Vancouver.
        - p:
            VanHacks is designed around the mantra of acting local and
            thinking global. All hacks are encouraged to be published
            open source so that an organization in Vancouver can benefit
            just as much as a similar nonprofit on the other side of
            Canada or the other side of the World.

            At Vanhacks 2019, we are trying something new that allows you hackers to be more creative.
            In past years, we’ve limited the groups served to five organizations who provided very
            specific
            asks. This year, we’ve decided to give you free reign over the group you’d like to hack for.
        - p:
            Use the list below to aid in your search for the non-profits that do amazing work around
            Vancouver, and think about how you can contribute to their cause.
        - p:
            Please reach out to any of these groups directly (or a nonprofit of your choice) and ask if
            there are any digital assets you can create that can power their mission.
