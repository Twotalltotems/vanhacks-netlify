about:
  descriptionMarkdown: >-
    VanHacks is an annual hackathon organized by TTT Studios around VSW
    dedicated to helping those helping our community. We call you, hackers of
    Vancouver, to join us over a weekend to create tech solutions that solve
    challenging issues faced by our community's not-for-profit institutions
    whose aim is to do social good. With your help, we can work towards building
    a better, more unified Vancouver.




    VanHacks is designed around the mantra of acting local and thinking global.
    All hacks are encouraged to be published open source so that an organization
    in Vancouver can benefit just as much as a similar nonprofit on the other
    side of Canada or the other side of the World.

    For VanHacks 2020, we will be bringing the hackathon online due to the
    current circumstances brought upon by the pandemic. Similar to previous
    years, hackers can get creative and pick the organization of their choice. 


    Use the list below to aid in your search for the non-profits that do amazing
    work around Vancouver, and think about how you can contribute to their
    cause.


    Please reach out to any of these groups directly (or a nonprofit of your
    choice) and ask if there are any digital assets you can create that can
    power their mission.
  instructions:
    - step: Look for a Vancouver NPO you want to hack for.
    - step: Reach out or do research to find their technical needs.
    - step: Team-up or find your team on the VanHacks slack channel.
    - step: Let the hacking begin!
