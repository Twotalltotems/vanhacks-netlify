    - p: >-
        VanHacks is an annual hackathon organized by TTT Studios around VSW
        dedicated to helping those helping our community. We call you, hackers
        of Vancouver, to join us over a weekend to create tech solutions that
        solve challenging issues faced by our community's not-for-profit
        institutions whose aim is to do social good. With your help, we can work
        towards building a better, more unified Vancouver.
    - p: >-
        VanHacks is designed around the mantra of acting local and thinking
        global. All hacks are encouraged to be published open source so that an
        organization in Vancouver can benefit just as much as a similar
        nonprofit on the other side of Canada or the other side of the World.

        At Vanhacks 2019, we are trying something new that allows you hackers to
        be more creative. In past years, we’ve limited the groups served to five
        organizations who provided very specific asks. This year, we’ve decided
        to give you free reign over the group you’d like to hack for.
    - p: >-
        Use the list below to aid in your search for the non-profits that do
        amazing work around Vancouver, and think about how you can contribute to
        their cause.
    - p: >-
        Please reach out to any of these groups directly (or a nonprofit of your
        choice) and ask if there are any digital assets you can create that can
        power their mission.
  instructions:
    - step: Look for a Vancouver NPO you want to hack for.
    - step: Reach out or do research to find their technical needs.
