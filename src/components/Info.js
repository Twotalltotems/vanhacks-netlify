                                        Participants spend 28 hours working in teams of 3-5 people to build an application
                                        that will benefit groups from the Vancouver community. It is up to the participants
                                        to take the challenges NPOs are facing and find ways to solve them through the
                                        applications they build over the weekend. In addition, mentors will be present to
                                        guide and advise participants on any difficulties they have when designing or
                                        building their applications. At the end of the 28 hours, each team will demo their
